🚧 Multiplayer Web Game for Vibe Jam 2025
Inspired by Twisted Metal 3
Hey there — I’m hiring a developer to help me build a quick, playable web-based car combat game for submission to an AI-powered game dev competition. This isn’t about building the next blockbuster hit — it’s about building something fun, functional, and fast that I can use as a marketing tool to generate attention for my various businesses.
The concept is inspired by one of my favorite childhood games: Twisted Metal 3, with specific inspiration from the Washington D.C. map. This is not intended to be a direct replica — just a spiritual nod to the gameplay format, energy, and aesthetic.
You can play Twisted Metal 3 online here:
🔗 https://www.retrogames.cc/psx-games/twisted-metal-3.html
You can access the Washington D.C. map and specific vehicles using passcodes from this page:
🔗 https://twistedmetal.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Metal_III_Cheats#Level_Passwords
Please reference these resources to get a better idea of the mechanics and vibe of the game. They are especially helpful for vehicle feel, map layout, and enemy behavior inspiration.

🧠 Project Direction
This game is a multiplayer co-op vs AI arena car combat game, where users select their vehicle, drop into a shared battlefield, and work together to fight an AI boss named “Semi-Trump.”
“Semi-Trump” is a satirical character based on Twisted Metal 3’s Darkside — a large semi-truck — but with Donald Trump hanging out of the driver’s side window, trash-talking and aggressively hunting players down.
There will be no special attacks. Instead, all vehicles from Twisted Metal 3 will be playable and differentiated by stat variety. The goal is to make the game immediately fun and playable, with different combinations of vehicles making each session feel unique.
 
🛠️ Developer Requirements
•	I will set up and provide access to a GitHub repository — all development must occur within this repo so I can retain access.
•	You are expected to commit code daily, or more frequently, so I can track progress and provide feedback in real-time.
•	The game must be built with AI-generated code, using tools such as Cursor, OpenAI’s Code Interpreter, or others, to satisfy Vibe Jam’s 80% AI-generated code rule.
•	No external UI, sound, or 3D assets will be provided. All assets should be generated using tools like:
o	https://trellis3d.co/
o	Open-source generators
o	Prompts to LLMs
•	The #1 priority is to get a working skeleton of the game live and hosted ASAP — even with placeholders. The game must be playable and publicly accessible on the domain/subdomain so that it can be submitted to the competition, even if not every listed feature is implemented perfectly by the deadline.
 
💰 Budget & Milestones
The project is divided into milestones, prioritized by importance and deadline urgency. Milestone 1 must result in a fully playable and hosted game that meets all competition rules.
Milestone 1 – Core Game – $1000
•	Full playable build
•	All vehicles selectable
•	AI boss (Semi-Trump) working with scaling difficulty
•	Map and item pickups implemented
•	Multiplayer functional (WebSocket or similar)
•	Hosted on provided subdomain and meets all Vibe Jam rules
Milestone 2+ – Feature Expansions (Time-Permitting) – $250 each
Additional milestones will be defined based on time and capacity. Possible features include:
•	New AI boss variants
•	More item types
•	Additional map areas or alternate maps
•	Cosmetic improvements
•	Environment destructibles
•	Player stats, leaderboards, and persistent session tracking
•	Sound design or character voice lines (AI-generated)
 
🧱 Milestone 1: Core Game Build
✅ Core Gameplay
•	User visits the site, enters a username, and selects a vehicle.
•	Background of the selection screen features a live aerial view of the battlefield.
•	After selection, the player is immediately dropped into the live arena with any other connected players.
•	Players cooperatively fight Semi-Trump, the AI boss vehicle.
•	Boss AI behavior:
o	Spawns periodically
o	Difficulty (health, damage, aggression) scales linearly with player count
•	Upon boss defeat:
o	Item pickups are dropped
o	A short rest period triggers before a stronger version of Semi-Trump respawns
•	Players see a "Boss Kill Streak" counter on-screen that resets when:
o	They die
o	They refresh or leave the page
•	If a player dies:
o	They enter a 20-second spectator mode
o	Then respawn in the arena with kill streak reset
 
🗺️ Map: Washington D.C. Arena
📖 Reference: https://twistedmetal.fandom.com/wiki/Washington_D.C.
•	Arena is a large rectangle, sized so that it takes ~10 seconds to drive across
•	North side: Washington Monument structure
•	South side: White House structure (large, with limited escape routes)
•	Spawn points: Players spawn on the north side, facing the White House
•	All walls, objects, and vehicles must have collision detection — no clipping, falling, or glitching
•	Advertising panels will be embedded into the outer walls:
o	These will act as virtual billboards
o	We will use them to display business names, websites, and social handles
o	I will provide the ad content during development
 
🚗 Playable Vehicles
All 13 vehicles from Twisted Metal III are available. No special attacks — just stat differences for variety.

o	Fires freeze missiles and short-range flamethrowers
•	Scaling: Health, aggression, and damage increase as more players join
•	Drops pickups after defeat, restarts stronger each round
 
🎯 Item Pickups
Spawn at all 4 corners of the map. Randomized. Respawn every 30 seconds:
1.	Homing Missile – Locks on and deals moderate damage
2.	Freeze Missile – Freezes enemy for 5 seconds (no damage)
3.	Full Health – Restores health to 100%
4.	Rapid Fire – Temporarily increases machine gun fire rate
 
🌐 Portal Integration (REQUIRED)
•	Exit portal is placed in front of the Washington Monument
•	Walking or driving into the portal redirects to: http://portal.pieter.com
•	Must append GET parameters to the URL:
o	?username=
o	?color=
o	?speed=
o	?ref=
•	If ?portal=true is in the URL, the player must spawn coming out of a portal in-game
•	Returning through a start portal must bring them back to the original ref URL with the same params
 
✅ REQUIRED FOR PAYMENT
The following are non-negotiable deliverables for Milestone 1:
1.	All Vibe Jam rules are satisfied
2.	Portal integration is implemented fully and correctly
3.	Game is hosted on a live domain and supports multiple users
4.	Game is playable in-browser, even if every detail or polish item isn’t completed
 
Let me know when you’re ready to get started or if you need clarification on anything before diving in. Looking forward to working together to build something quick, chaotic, and fun.
